  <p> There isn't a single relationship that doesn't have great difficulties arise, the challenge of staying together is often much greater than to seperate.
  Here we share our struggle to stay together, no matter the distance, the fights, the hurt feelings, etc. and the actions we took to stay together and grow
  stronger as individuals through our relationship.
